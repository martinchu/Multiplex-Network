# Multiplex-Network

Contributor: Iduoriyekemwen Hayford, Jessica Huang, Martin Chu

## Context:


Sergueiva (2016) provided her insight in the relationship between Multilayer Network and Financial Systems. Multilayer networks
She introduced the Multiplexes, a specific type of multilayer network, has multiple layers that consist of mostly the same nodes, and edges within a layer exist only between different nodes while links between layers exist only between instances of the same node in different layers.



Single-layer networks cannot address the interactions among entities.

## Meaning

## Scope


 <!-- problem of the financial systems -->

<!-- The multilayer network research is not well-developed. -->
<!-- In this paper/research, a node represents a financial entity and an edge represents a relation -->
