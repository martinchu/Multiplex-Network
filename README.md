## Context:


Sergueiva (2016) provided her insight in the relationship between Multilayer Network and Financial Systems. Multilayer networks
She introduced the Multiplexes, a specific type of multilayer network, has multiple layers that consist of mostly the same nodes, and edges within a layer exist only between different nodes while links between layers exist only between instances of the same node in different layers.

The problem has been backed up by the Empirical data in the research paper. The research has incorporated 2 databases from the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Bank of England’s supervisory arm.

There are 3 layers of inter-institutional exposures, where each corresponds to the exposure structure within a different type of market – fixed-income, securities-financing, and derivatives.


Single-layer networks cannot address the interactions among entities.

## Meaning


## Scope


 <!-- problem of the financial systems -->

<!-- The multilayer network research is not well-developed. -->
<!-- In this paper/research, a node represents a financial entity and an edge represents a relation -->
